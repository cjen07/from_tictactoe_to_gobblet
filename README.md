### remark

* this repo is forked from [here](https://github.com/ventsislaf/talks)
  
### experiment

- [x] using Resgistry in Elixir 1.4 instead of [gproc](https://github.com/uwiger/gproc) 
- [ ] bug from original repo: when a player logs out and another player joins the previous game, the game is stuck. 
- [ ] modify tictactoe to build a "globblet globbler" game using Phaser and Elm

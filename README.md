## some tictactoe expriments

### remark

* this repo is forked from [here](https://github.com/ventsislaf/talks)
  
### experiments

- [x] using Registry in Elixir 1.4 instead of [gproc](https://github.com/uwiger/gproc).
- [x] error message from original repo: [link](https://github.com/ventsislaf/talks/issues/1).
- [ ] bug from original repo: when one game is finished, no player clicks the new game button, then a player logs out and another player joins the previous game, the game is stuck.
- [ ] modify tictactoe to build a "globblet globbler" game using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).
